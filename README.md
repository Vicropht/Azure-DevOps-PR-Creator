# Azure-DevOps-PR-Creator

###A simple bash script to create multiple PRs (with one command!) for different repositories in Azure DevOps

This script uses [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) to connect to DevOps.

Please make sure to edit the bash script and edit all ```[VARIABLES]``` accordingly!

PR without any changes will still be created! See: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/21177
