# Azure-DevOps-PR-Creator
A simple bash script to create multiple PRs (with one command!) for different repositories in Azure DevOps

Please make sure to edit the bash script and edit all ```[VARIABLES]``` accordingly!

PR without any changes will still be created! See: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/21177
